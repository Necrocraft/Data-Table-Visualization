A Data Table Visualization using Material UI and Nivo. The project involved creating a data table and then plotting the values inputted inside that table on a Chord Diagram using Nivo Data Visualization library.

The table is completely editable and a max of 3 digit number can be input and the sum of the column is then calculated accordingly.

The table also allows to click on the last cell and that will plot the column with random number that sum to 100.

The complete project was then hosted using Firebase and is available on the url "https://data-table-visualization.web.app/"

Technologies used are React Hooks, Redux, Material UI, Nivo and Firebase.
